# User Knowledge Modeling

This project is an attempt to predict user knowledge level from results on goal materials. The dataset was proposed by the UCI machine learning [(Here)](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/User+Knowledge+Modeling) in 2009. Many of the solutions at the time
made use of traditional machine learning techniques.
